            Developer note:

            To implement real sharing you could use:
            1. The Web Share API (for supported browsers):

               if (navigator.share) {
                 navigator.share({
                   title: 'My PM Strengths & Learning Style',

                   url: window.location.href
                 });
               }

            2. Or build specific links for WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.
